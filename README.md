This Project uses **RPYC (Transparent, Symmetric Distributed Computing)** approach. RPyC (pronounced as are-pie-see), or Remote Python Call, is a transparent python library for symmetrical remote procedure calls, clustering and distributed-computing. RPyC makes use of object-proxying, a technique that employs pythonâ€™s dynamic nature, to overcome the physical boundaries between processes and computers, so that remote objects can be manipulated as if they were local.
